## CC9K - Coding Challenge 9000

CC9K is a hobby project consisting of solving coding challenges. Some of the projects were taken from [Project Euler] (https://projecteuler.net/), other challenges were designed by ourselves. The idea is to implement a solution that is preferably as fast as possible. However, code readability should not be completely neglected, hence there should be a healthy trade-off between speed and code readability.

1. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 up to one million. 
2. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
3. Randomly generate a sequence of 8 000 000 nucleotides (A, T, G, C) in FASTA format (80 characters per line separated by a newline) and save to .txt file.
4. The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime. How many circular primes are there below one million?
5. How many, not necessarily distinct, values of $\binom{n}{r}$ for $1\leq n \leq 100$, are greater than one-million?
